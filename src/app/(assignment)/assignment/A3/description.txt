I felt like the idea of gaussian splatting is very intuitive; you're trying to
repaint a scene just with a bunch of small blobs you get to control, such as
their shape, size, and color. Since the theme is Art of Points, I decided to
train the gaussian parameters on another famous art piece, the Starry Night by
Van Gogh. At the end, the only tricky part was figuring out the gotchas with
implementing the matrix equations in GLSL, but otherwise I liked the assignment!
