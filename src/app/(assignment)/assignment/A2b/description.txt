Implementing the volume rendering for training the NeRF model was a little
tricky due to the dimensions of the tensors, but was mostly straightforward.
I was also able to borrow a lot of code from my previous assignment for the
volume rendering method on the GLSL file.

For my creative expression, I decided to train a NeRF model on the drum set.
However, my twist was to phase the drum back and forth with the lego model in
the scene over time. I got this idea since I was trying to render both at once,
but my computer was lagging so much that I had to devise a way to include both
models in my scene. I used the mix() function to blend the models together,
along with a mixing parameter dependent on sine and iTime.
